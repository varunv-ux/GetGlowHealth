## 🎯 How It Works

### The app now automatically detects which mode to use:

```javascript
if (R2 credentials exist) {
  → Upload to Cloudflare R2 ☁️
  → Store URL in database
  → Fast CDN delivery
} else {
  → Save to local disk 💾
  → Store local path in database
  → Good for development
}
```

### No code changes needed - just set environment variables!

## 🔍 Testing Your Setup

### Test 1: Check Configuration
```bash
# In your server logs, you should see:
📦 Storage mode: Cloudflare R2
```

### Test 2: Upload Image
1. Go to your app
2. Upload a face photo
3. Check console for:
```
✅ Uploaded to R2: https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev/uploads/1234567890-abc123.jpg (245.67 KB)
```

### Test 3: Verify Image Loads
1. Copy the URL from logs
2. Open in new browser tab
3. Image should load instantly

### Test 4: Check Database
```sql
SELECT image_url FROM analyses ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
```

Should return R2 URL like:
```
https://pub-xxxxx.r2.dev/uploads/1234567890-abc123.jpg
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "R2 storage is not configured"
→ Add R2 environment variables to `.env`

### "Failed to upload to R2"
→ Check your API token has "Object Read & Write" permissions

### Images don't load (403 Forbidden)
→ Make your bucket public in Cloudflare dashboard

### Local mode when R2 is configured
→ Check for typos in environment variable names
