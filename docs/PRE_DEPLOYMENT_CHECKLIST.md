## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit and Push
```bash
# Stage documentation files
git add STREAMING_TEST_REPORT.md \
        DEPLOY_AND_TEST_GUIDE.md \
        STREAMING_ARCHITECTURE.md \
        READY_TO_TEST.md \
        test-vercel-streaming.sh \
        PRE_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md

# Commit
git commit -m "Add streaming implementation and testing documentation"

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
- [ ] Check Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Note the deployment URL

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
- [ ] Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Browser Test:
1. [ ] Visit Vercel URL
2. [ ] Upload test image (face photo)
3. [ ] Click "Start Analysis"
4. [ ] Watch animated loader (should not timeout)
5. [ ] Wait 20-40 seconds
6. [ ] Verify redirect to /history
7. [ ] Check results are displayed

### Browser DevTools Test:
1. [ ] Open DevTools (F12)
2. [ ] Go to Network tab
3. [ ] Filter by "eventsource" or look for `/start-streaming`
4. [ ] Verify:
   - [ ] Status: 200 OK
   - [ ] Type: text/event-stream
   - [ ] Connection stays open 20-40s
   - [ ] Events stream in

### Console Test:
1. [ ] Open Console tab
2. [ ] Look for polling logs:
   - [ ] "üîÑ Polling for analysis: X"
   - [ ] "üìä Analysis status: processing"
   - [ ] "‚úÖ Polling stopped. Final status: completed"
3. [ ] No error messages

### Automated Test:
```bash
# Replace with your Vercel URL
./test-vercel-streaming.sh https://your-app.vercel.app
```

Expected results:
- [ ] All 5 tests pass
- [ ] No timeout errors
- [ ] Analysis completes
- [ ] Results saved to database

### Vercel Logs Test:
1. [ ] Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. [ ] Watch for:
   - [ ] `[HANDLER] POST /api/analysis/:id/start-streaming`
   - [ ] `üì• Downloading image from R2`
   - [ ] `‚úÖ Streaming analysis completed, X chunks`
3. [ ] No timeout errors
4. [ ] No "Function Invocation Failed" errors

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build fails on Vercel
**Check:**
- [ ] `package.json` scripts are correct
- [ ] All dependencies are in package.json
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

### Issue: "Environment variable not set"
**Solution:**
- [ ] Go to Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- [ ] Add missing variables
- [ ] Redeploy

### Issue: Still timing out
**Check:**
- [ ] Client is calling `/start-streaming` (not `/start`)
- [ ] SSE headers are correct
- [ ] OpenAI `stream: true` is set
- [ ] Check Vercel logs for specific error

### Issue: Analysis never completes
**Check:**
- [ ] Database status field
- [ ] OpenAI API quota/limits
- [ ] Vercel logs for errors
- [ ] Check if response is valid JSON

## üìä Expected Performance

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Upload Time | 1-3 seconds |
| Streaming Analysis | 20-40 seconds |
| Database Save | <1 second |
| **Total** | **~25-45 seconds** |
| Timeout Risk | **0% (was 100%)** |

## üìù Post-Deployment Tasks

After successful test:
- [ ] Mark this checklist complete
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Update READY_TO_TEST.md with results
- [ ] Share Vercel URL for team testing
- [ ] Monitor first few production uses
- [ ] Set up Vercel alerts (optional)

---

## üéâ Ready to Deploy?

If all items above are checked or verified:

```bash
# Final command to deploy
