# GPT-4.1 Model Upgrade

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Model Information
- **Current Model**: `gpt-4.1`
- **Previous Model**: `gpt-4o`
- **Status**: ✅ Latest valid OpenAI model (as of October 2024)
- **Streaming**: ✅ Fully supported

## Why GPT-4.1?

### Key Improvements Over GPT-4o
1. **Better Instruction Following**: 87.4% on IFEval (vs 81.0% for GPT-4o)
2. **Improved Coding**: 54.6% on SWE-bench Verified (+21.4% absolute improvement)
3. **Enhanced Multi-step Instructions**: 38.3% on MultiChallenge (vs 27.8% for GPT-4o)
4. **Larger Context**: 1M token context window (up from 128K)
5. **Better Pricing**: 26% cheaper - $2 input/$8 output per 1M tokens (vs $2.50/$10 for GPT-4o)

### Benefits for GetGlow
- **More Detailed Analysis**: Better instruction following means more accurate facial analysis
- **Reduced Generic Summaries**: GPT-4.1 is better at following specific instructions instead of using template text
- **Better JSON Compliance**: Improved at generating properly formatted JSON responses
- **Cost Savings**: 26% reduction in API costs while getting better results

## Configuration

### Current Settings
```typescript
model: "gpt-4.1"
temperature: 0.7 (from prompt config)
max_tokens: 4000 (from prompt config)
top_p: 0.9
stream: true
```

### Location
File: `/server/streaming-analysis.ts`
Lines: 39-78

## Testing Notes
- Streaming works perfectly with GPT-4.1
- SSE (Server-Sent Events) fully compatible
- No breaking changes from GPT-4o
- Response format: JSON object mode supported

## Migration Notes
- Simply changed model name from "gpt-4o" to "gpt-4.1"
- No other code changes required
- Backward compatible with existing prompts
- All existing functionality preserved

## Real-World Performance
According to OpenAI's benchmarks with real companies:
- **Windsurf**: 60% better at coding tasks
- **Blue J**: 53% more accurate on complex analysis
- **Hex**: 2× improvement on SQL generation
- **Thomson Reuters**: 17% better at multi-document review

## Important Notes
- GPT-4.1 is "more literal" - be explicit and specific in prompts
- Best for tasks requiring precise instruction following
- Ideal for agent-based applications (like GetGlow's facial analysis)
- Recommended by OpenAI as the primary model going forward

## Verification
To verify the model is working:
1. Check logs for: `"Using temperature: 0.7, maxTokens: 4000"`
2. Verify streaming chunks are received
3. Confirm JSON parsing succeeds
4. Check `rawAnalysis.model` field in response = "gpt-4.1"
