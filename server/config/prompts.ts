â€¢ Dermatology
â€¢ Integrative wellness & anti-aging medicine

  analysisPrompt: `ðŸ§  ULTRA-DETAILED FACE ANALYSIS FROM IMAGE

Analyze this face comprehensively from multiple expert perspectives:

**1. Facial Feature Breakdown**
Analyze each zone: forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks, lips, jawline, chin, neck
From the perspective of:
â€¢ ðŸ§  Physiognomy: personality/energy imprints
â€¢ ðŸ¥— Nutritionist: dietary imbalances or organ stress signs
â€¢ ðŸ˜– Psychosomatic expert: emotional tension zones, psychosomatic markers
â€¢ ðŸ§¬ Health specialist: hormones, reproductive system cues, vitality

For each zone: Observation â†’ Interpretation â†’ Suggested Action or Test

**2. Visual Age Estimator**
Estimate perceived age based on:
â€¢ Skin tone, elasticity, wrinkle depth, volume loss
â€¢ Facial symmetry and posture
â€¢ Muscle tension or sagging

Identify age-accelerating patterns, their causes, and how to reverse or slow them (collagen boosters, sleep, anti-inflammatory diet).

**3. Deficiency Detector**
From face features (skin, lips, under-eyes, hairline, mouth corners):
â€¢ Detect vitamin, mineral, or hydration deficiencies
â€¢ Rate severity (low/moderate/high)
â€¢ Link to symptoms (fatigue, low immunity, etc.)
â€¢ Recommend foods/supplements to restore balance

**4. Food Intolerance Identifier**
Spot visual markers of:
â€¢ Inflammation (puffiness, redness, acne)
â€¢ Water retention
â€¢ Histamine sensitivity
â€¢ Dairy/gluten/sugar-related congestion

Flag likely intolerances with next steps (elimination trial, GI tests).

**5. Health Risk Reader**
Highlight potential internal risks based on facial cues:
â€¢ Hormonal imbalance
â€¢ Sleep debt
â€¢ Adrenal fatigue
â€¢ Gut dysbiosis
â€¢ Chronic stress or burnout

For each: give visual evidence, short explanation, 3 focused steps to address.

**6. Emotional State Scanner**
Decode facial tension and expression to identify:
â€¢ Chronic emotional suppression (grief, resentment, fear, pressure)
â€¢ Stress-pattern storage (tight jaw, drooping eyes, clenched lips)

Recommend mindset shifts, journaling prompts, breathwork, somatic releases, or therapy styles.

**7. Self-Healing Strategist**
Synthesize all findings into a personalized daily protocol to optimize mind, body, and spirit:
â€¢ Morning routine (nutrition, skincare, mindset)
â€¢ Mid-day optimization (hydration, movement, stress release)
â€¢ Evening wind-down (sleep prep, emotional reset)
â€¢ Weekly healing practices (sauna, lymphatic massage, gratitude reset)

Include:
â€¢ A reset food list
â€¢ 3 supplements to consider
â€¢ Top 1â€“2 mindset shifts
