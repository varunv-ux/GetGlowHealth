  analysisPrompt: `Analyze this image comprehensively using the following wellness-focused framework. For EACH observation, provide a CONFIDENCE LEVEL (low/medium/high) and cite the VISIBLE EVIDENCE you're seeing.

**1. Comprehensive Skin Health Analysis**
Perform detailed skin assessment:
• TEXTURE: Analyze smoothness, pores, fine lines, skin quality (cite what you see)
• TONE: Assess evenness, coloration, undertones, brightness (cite what you see)
• HYDRATION: Evaluate moisture levels, dryness, plumpness (cite what you see)
• VISIBLE CONDITIONS: Identify any visible concerns (redness, spots, dark circles, etc.)
• CONFIDENCE LEVEL: Rate your confidence (low/medium/high) for each observation
For each finding: Specific Observation → Visual Evidence → Wellness Recommendation

**2. Facial Zone Wellness Assessment**
Analyze each zone (forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks, lips, jawline, chin, neck):
• OBSERVATION: What specific visual characteristics do you see?
• WELLNESS INTERPRETATION: What might this suggest about lifestyle, sleep, hydration, nutrition?
• CONFIDENCE: How confident are you in this observation? (low/medium/high)
• SUGGESTED ACTION: Specific, actionable wellness recommendations

**3. Lifestyle & Wellness Indicators**
Based on visible characteristics, suggest possible lifestyle optimizations:
• SLEEP QUALITY: Visual indicators of rest/fatigue (with confidence level)
• HYDRATION: Signs of water intake levels (with confidence level)

• EVENING PROTOCOL: Wind-down and recovery (sleep prep, relaxation, skin care)
• WEEKLY HABITS: Deeper wellness practices (self-care, reflection, rejuvenation)
• MIND-BODY CONNECTION: Integration practices for holistic health

**5. Nutritional Wellness Suggestions**
Based on visible skin and facial characteristics:
• Identify potential nutritional areas to optimize (vitamins, minerals, hydration)
• Rate confidence level for each suggestion (low/medium/high)
• Provide specific whole foods recommendations
• Suggest lifestyle changes that support these nutrients
**Note:** Recommend consulting a nutritionist for personalized advice

**6. Personalized Wellness Protocol**
Synthesize all findings into an actionable daily/weekly plan:
• TOP 3 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS: Most impactful changes to start today
• NUTRITIONAL FOCUS: Specific foods and hydration goals
• LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS: Sleep, stress management, movement
• SKINCARE ROUTINE: Morning and evening recommendations
• SUPPLEMENT CONSIDERATIONS: Suggestions to discuss with healthcare provider
• MINDSET & SELF-CARE: Mental wellness practices

**7. Progress Tracking Recommendations**
Suggest measurable wellness goals:
• What to track daily (sleep, water intake, energy levels)
